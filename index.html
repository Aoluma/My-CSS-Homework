			<p>Equally, we are calling on the peaceful protestors in the Sit-in in Khartoum and beyond to continue exercising their freedom of expression and their right of peaceful assembly while maintaining public safety, public order, the protection of public health and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. This is the only guarantee for a civil and democratic state that respects the rule of law and responds to the hopes and aspirations of Sudanese people who have endured the suffering and agony of conflicts and injustice for almost 30 years.</p>

		<p>As lawyers, we would like to stress the importance of Sudan’s commitment to its international and regional obligations particularly the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights adopted by the Republic of Sudan since 1986 - mainly article 19 and article 20; and Sudan’s commitment to its people, peace and security as stated in the African Charters for Humans and People Rights. All instruments grant the citizens’ rights to peaceful association and freedom of expression and opinions.</p>
